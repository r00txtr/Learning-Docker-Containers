# Docker Learning Journey Documentation

### 1. **Introduction to Docker:**
   - **Definition:** Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization. Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for easy deployment.
   - **Key Concepts:**
      - *Container:* A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
      - *Image:* A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Images are used to create containers.
      - *Containerization:* The process of encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container to ensure consistency across different environments.
      - *Dockerfile:* A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the environment inside the container.
      - **Docker Hub:** Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository where Docker users can find, share, and store container images. It serves as a central resource for Docker images, allowing users to easily access and distribute pre-built containers.
      - **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the services, networks, and volumes required for an application, enabling developers to define complex environments with multiple interconnected containers.
      - **Docker Swarm:** Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers. It allows users to create and manage a cluster of Docker hosts, enabling high availability, scalability, and load balancing for containerized applications.
      - **Docker Registry:** A Docker Registry is a storage and distribution service for Docker images. It stores Docker images that can be shared within an organization or publicly accessible. Docker Hub is a popular example of a Docker Registry, but organizations can also set up private registries for internal use.
      - **Docker Volume:** A Docker Volume is a persistent data storage mechanism for Docker containers. Volumes enable containers to store and share data across container restarts or when containers are moved between hosts. They provide a way to manage data that needs to persist beyond the lifetime of a container.
      - **Docker Networking:** Docker Networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with external networks. Docker provides a range of networking options, including bridge networks, overlay networks, and host networks, to facilitate communication between containers and connect containers to external resources.
      - **Dockerfile Best Practices:** Dockerfile Best Practices refer to guidelines and recommendations for writing efficient and secure Dockerfiles. These best practices help optimize Docker images, reduce image size, minimize security vulnerabilities, and improve the overall performance of containerized applications.

### 2. **Basic Docker Commands:**
   - **Installation and Setup:**
      - Install Docker Desktop for your operating system from the official Docker website.
      - Verify the installation with the following commands:
         ```bash
         docker --version
         docker run hello-world
         ```
   - **Managing Containers:**
      - `docker run <image-name>`: Creates and starts a new container from an image. For example:
         ```bash
         docker run -d --name my-container nginx
         ```
      - `docker ps`: Lists running containers.
      - `docker stop <container-id>`: Stops a running container.
      - `docker rm <container-id>`: Removes a stopped container.
   - **Working with Images:**
      - `docker images`: Lists all available Docker images.
      - `docker pull <image-name>`: Downloads an image from a repository. For example:
         ```bash
         docker pull ubuntu:20.04
         ```
      - `docker rmi <image-id>`: Removes an image from the local machine.
   - **Building Images:**
      - Create a Dockerfile with instructions for building the image. Here's an example Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application:
         ```Dockerfile
         FROM node:14
         WORKDIR /app
         COPY package*.json ./
         RUN npm install
         COPY . .
         EXPOSE 3000
         CMD ["npm", "start"]
         ```
      - Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:
         ```bash
         docker build -t my-node-app .
         ```
   - **Networking:**
      - `docker network ls`: Lists Docker networks.
      - `docker network create <network-name>`: Creates a new Docker network. For example:
         ```bash
         docker network create my-network
         ```
   - **Managing Docker Volumes:**
     - `docker volume ls`: Lists Docker volumes.
     - `docker volume create <volume-name>`: Creates a new Docker volume.
     - `docker volume rm <volume-name>`: Removes a Docker volume.
   - **Inspecting Containers and Images:**
     - `docker inspect <container-or-image>`: Displays detailed information about a container or image.
     - `docker stats <container-id>`: Displays live system resource usage statistics for a running container.
   - **Container Logs:**
     - `docker logs <container-id>`: Displays the logs of a container.
     - `docker logs -f <container-id>`: Follows the logs of a container in real-time.
   - **Managing Docker Swarm (if applicable):**
     - `docker swarm init`: Initializes a Docker Swarm on the current node.
     - `docker swarm join`: Joins a node to an existing Docker Swarm.
     - `docker service <command>`: Manages Docker services in a Swarm.
     - `docker node <command>`: Manages Docker Swarm nodes.
   - **Managing Docker Registry (if applicable):**
     - `docker login`: Logs in to a Docker registry.
     - `docker push <image-name>`: Pushes a Docker image to a registry.
     - `docker pull <image-name>`: Pulls a Docker image from a registry.
   - **Cleaning Up Docker Resources:**
     - `docker system prune`: Removes unused data such as stopped containers, dangling images, and unused networks and volumes.
     - `docker container prune`: Removes all stopped containers.
     - `docker image prune`: Removes unused images.
     - `docker volume prune`: Removes unused volumes.

      - Build the Docker image and run the container locally.
   - **Deployment with Docker Compose:**
      - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define multi-container applications. Here's an example for a simple web application with a frontend and backend:
         ```yaml
         version: '3'
         services:
           frontend:
             build: ./frontend
             ports:
               - "80:80"
           backend:
             build: ./backend
             ports:
               - "8000:8000"
         ```
      - Run and manage multi-container Docker applications using Docker Compose:
