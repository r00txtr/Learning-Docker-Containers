# Docker Learning Journey Documentation

### 1. **Introduction to Docker:**
   - **Definition:** Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization. Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for easy deployment.
   - **Key Concepts:**
      - *Container:* A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
      - *Image:* A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Images are used to create containers.
      - *Containerization:* The process of encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container to ensure consistency across different environments.
      - *Dockerfile:* A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the environment inside the container.

### 2. **Basic Docker Commands:**
   - **Installation and Setup:**
      - Install Docker Desktop for your operating system from the official Docker website.
      - Verify the installation with the following commands:
         ```bash
         docker --version
         docker run hello-world
         ```
   - **Managing Containers:**
      - `docker run <image-name>`: Creates and starts a new container from an image. For example:
         ```bash
         docker run -d --name my-container nginx
         ```
      - `docker ps`: Lists running containers.
      - `docker stop <container-id>`: Stops a running container.
      - `docker rm <container-id>`: Removes a stopped container.
   - **Working with Images:**
      - `docker images`: Lists all available Docker images.
      - `docker pull <image-name>`: Downloads an image from a repository. For example:
         ```bash
         docker pull ubuntu:20.04
         ```
      - `docker rmi <image-id>`: Removes an image from the local machine.
   - **Building Images:**
      - Create a Dockerfile with instructions for building the image. Here's an example Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application:
         ```Dockerfile
         FROM node:14
         WORKDIR /app
         COPY package*.json ./
         RUN npm install
         COPY . .
         EXPOSE 3000
         CMD ["npm", "start"]
         ```
      - Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:
         ```bash
         docker build -t my-node-app .
         ```
   - **Networking:**
      - `docker network ls`: Lists Docker networks.
      - `docker network create <network-name>`: Creates a new Docker network. For example:
         ```bash
         docker network create my-network
         ```

### 3. **Containerization and Deployment:**
   - **Containerizing an Application:**
      - Write a Dockerfile for a sample application. For example, create a Dockerfile for a basic Flask web application.
      - Build the Docker image and run the container locally.
   - **Deployment with Docker Compose:**
      - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define multi-container applications. Here's an example for a simple web application with a frontend and backend:
         ```yaml
         version: '3'
         services:
           frontend:
             build: ./frontend
             ports:
               - "80:80"
           backend:
             build: ./backend
             ports:
               - "8000:8000"
         ```
      - Run and manage multi-container Docker applications using Docker Compose:
         ```bash
         docker-compose up -d
         ```

### 4. **Hands-On Exercises:**
   - **Exercise 1 - Running Containers:**
      - Pull a Docker image from Docker Hub and run a container. For example:
         ```bash
         docker run -d --name my-nginx nginx
         ```
   - **Exercise 2 - Building Images:**
      - Write a Dockerfile for a simple web server using Nginx.
      - Build the Docker image and run a container from it.
   - **Exercise 3 - Docker Compose:**
      - Define a multi-container application using Docker Compose.
      - Run the application and verify its functionality.
